"""

recoupment_language_description = """
Extract the section(s) from the document that define when and how the Producer becomes eligible for royalty payments, based on recoupment of certain costs.

You're looking for language related to the Producer's Royalty being contingent upon recoupment of Recording Costs, Advances, or Approved Budgets from Net Artist Royalties or similar pools.

Trigger Logic to Identify:
- Look for phrases like:
  - "No royalty shall be payable until..."
  - "Producer's Royalty shall be paid retroactively from record one after..."
  - "After recoupment of Recording Costs..."
  - "Unless and until Company has recouped..."

What is Being Recouped:
- Recording Costs
- Advances / Producer Advance
- Approved Budgets
- Sometimes: Sample Clearance Costs, Out-of-pocket costs

What is Excluded from Recoupment:
- In-pocket advances paid to Artist
- Third-party advances (e.g., mixers, co-producers)
- Marketing or Mechanical royalties

Source of Recoupment Pool:
- "Net Artist Royalties"
- "Net Artist Rate"
- "Net Royalty" (Artist’s all-in royalty minus participant royalties)

Recoupment Limits:
- Look for clauses like "Advance shall be recouped one time only" or "for the avoidance of doubt" to identify limitations on double deductions.

Your task is to extract the full sentence or paragraph that explains this recoupment mechanism. If multiple statements contribute to the explanation, return them together as a block of text.

- “[Entity], a division of [Parent Company]”

Common placements:
- In the opening paragraph or in sections describing ownership, release rights, or label hierarchy
- May appear alongside the label or be synonymous with the **Label** itself

Heuristic:
- If the **Distributor** is not explicitly stated but the **Label** is, and there is no conflicting information, it is typically safe to assume the **Label and Distributor are the same**.

Example:
- “released by Atlantic Records, a division of Warner Music Group (“Company”)”

Expected Output:
- The **name of the distributor** (e.g., “Atlantic Records”, “Empire”, “The Orchard”)

"""


label_description = """
Extract the **Label Owned By** value from the agreement. This identifies the **parent company** or **ownership structure** of the label associated with the release.

---

🧠 What to Look For:
You are trying to determine which **larger company owns or controls** the label mentioned in the contract. Ownership is usually mentioned explicitly or can be inferred from phrasing.

---

🔍 Common Ownership Phrases (High Confidence):
Look for these patterns where a label name is followed by an ownership relationship:
- "[Label Name], a division of [Parent Company]"
- "[Label Name], owned by [Parent Company]"
- "[Label Name], an imprint of [Parent Company]"
- "[Label Name] (a wholly owned subsidiary of [Parent Company])"
- "[Label Name] is distributed by [Parent Company]"

📌 Common Keywords (Search Around These):
- “a division of”
- “owned by”
- “controlled by”
- “an imprint of”
- “under”
- “released by”
- “distributed by”
- “subsidiary of”
- “label group”

---

💡 Heuristic Matching (Medium Confidence):
- If explicit ownership is not mentioned, but the **label is a known industry name**, use a preloaded label-to-parent mapping (e.g., "Republic Records" → "Universal Music Group").

- If multiple entities are mentioned (e.g., distributor and label), prioritize **label → parent** relationships.

---

📄 Examples:
- “Atlantic Records, a division of Warner Music Group”
- “Released by Alamo Records, under Sony Music Entertainment”
- “XYZ Label, owned and controlled by Universal Music Group”
- “Cactus Jack is an imprint of Epic Records, a division of Sony Music”

lawyer_information_description = """
Extract the **Lawyer Information** from the agreement. These will typically be listed using the label **“C/O”** (care of), and there are usually **two parties** listed.

  - Address blocks or contact details beginning with “C/O”
- Usually, both the **Client Party’s lawyer** and the **Counterparty’s lawyer** are listed.

type_of_royalty_description = """
You are reviewing a music contract to determine the basis on which the Producer's royalty is calculated. There are only two acceptable values for this field:

- "NAR" – Net Artist Rate / Royalties
- "PPD" – Published Price to Dealers

Do NOT return a default or inferred value. You must be extremely confident based on explicit language in the document. If confidence is not high, return "Not Found".

Understanding the Two Options:

1. NAR (Net Artist Rate)
- The royalty is calculated as a percentage of the Artist’s royalties.
- It is a piece of the artist’s pie — the producer only gets paid after the artist's share is allocated.

Keywords/Indicators:
- "net artist rate"
- "net artist royalties"
- "calculated on the same basis as Artist’s royalties"
- "from the ‘net artist royalties’"
- Definitions using: 
  - "gross all-in royalties payable to Artist minus royalties payable to Producer and other royalty participants"

2. PPD (Published Price to Dealers)
- The royalty is calculated as a percentage of the wholesale price — a fixed monetary base.
- This is often a more favorable basis for the producer.

Keywords/Indicators:
- "PPD"
- "Published Price to Dealers"
- "wholesale price"
- "price to dealers"
- "royalty based on the wholesale rate"

Extraction Instructions:

1. High-Confidence Match (Primary Signal)
   - If you find “PPD” or “Published Price to Dealers” used explicitly in the context of royalty calculation → return "PPD".
   - If you find “net artist royalties” or “net artist rate” in royalty calculation context → return "NAR".

2. Supporting Clauses (Secondary Signal)
   For NAR:
   - Phrases showing that producer royalties are deducted from the artist’s share.
   - Definitions involving "gross royalties payable to artist minus..."

   For PPD:
   - Simple language showing producer gets X% of wholesale price.
   - Absence of any mention of artist’s share or net definitions.

Return Format:
{
  "field": "Type of Royalty",
  "value": "NAR"
}
or
{
  "field": "Type of Royalty",
  "value": "PPD"
